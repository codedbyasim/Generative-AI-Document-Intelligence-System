Islamic Law & Jurisprudence
Lecture 05 & 06
Introduction to Islamic Law (Sharia)
• Definition: Sharia means "path to the water source," representing a 
comprehensive legal and ethical system guiding all aspects of a 
Muslim's life.
• Purpose: To guide behavior, ensuring justice, morality, and adherence 
to God’s will.
• Distinction: Differences between Sharia (the moral/legal framework) 
and Fiqh (jurisprudence, the human interpretation of Sharia).
Primary Sources of Islamic Law
• Quran: The literal word of God; addresses theology, morality, 
personal conduct, and law.
• Provides specific legal injunctions on marriage, inheritance, criminal justice.
• Hadith: Accounts of the Prophet’s sayings/actions, providing context 
and details not found in the Quran.
• Examples: Prophet’s judgment on theft and the concept of restitution.
Secondary Sources of Islamic Law
• Ijma (Consensus): Binding agreement among scholars on 
interpretations not directly covered by the Quran and Hadith.
• Historically significant in matters like inheritance laws and defining acts of 
worship.
• Qiyas (Analogy): Using established principles to address new 
situations, e.g., extending the prohibition of wine to drugs.
• Ijtihad: Independent reasoning to adapt Sharia to new circumstances.
Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence)
• The human understanding and interpretation of Islamic law (Sharia)
for practical application in daily life.
• Usul al-Fiqh (Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence):The methodology
and principles used to derive and interpret Islamic law (Fiqh) from
primary source.
Material of Usul al-Fiqh (Mawad al-Usul)
• Definition: The foundational components and elements used in the study 
and application of Islamic legal principles.
• Key Materials:
• Adillah Naqliyyah (Textual Evidence):
• Quran: The primary source of Sharia.
• Hadith: The sayings, actions, and approvals of Prophet Muhammad.
• Adillah Aqliyyah (Rational Evidence):
• Ijma (Consensus): Agreement of qualified Islamic scholars.
• Qiyas (Analogical Reasoning): Deriving rulings by analogy to established cases.
• Principles of Linguistics:
• Study of Arabic language, grammar, and semantics to understand texts.
Ahkam (Islamic Rulings)
• Definition: The legal rulings or judgments derived from Islamic law (Sharia) that guide a Muslim's 
actions.
• Five Categories of Ahkam:
• Fard (Obligatory): Actions that must be performed (e.g., daily prayers).
• Mustahabb (Recommended): Actions encouraged but not mandatory (e.g., voluntary fasting).
• Mubah (Permissible): Actions that are allowed without reward or punishment (e.g., eating certain 
foods).
• Makruh (Discouraged): Actions disliked but not sinful (e.g., wasting water).
• Haram (Prohibited): Actions that are strictly forbidden (e.g., theft, alcohol consumption).
Schools of Islamic Jurisprudence (Fiqh)
• Hanafi: Emphasizes reason and analogy, widely followed in South 
Asia, Turkey, Central Asia.
• Maliki: Based on the practices of the people of Medina, prevalent in 
North and West Africa.
• Shafi'i: Combines Quran, Hadith, consensus, and analogy, common in 
East Africa, Southeast Asia.
• Hanbali: Strict, emphasizes literal adherence, dominant in Saudi 
Arabia and the Gulf.
Origin and Development of Usul al-Fiqh
• 1. Early Islamic Era (7th-8th Century):
• Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) Time: Legal rulings were directly based on 
Quranic revelations and the Prophet's guidance.
• Rashidun Caliphs (R.A): Continued using Quran, Hadith, and reasoning 
(Ijtihad) to address new issues.
• 2. Formative Period (8th-9th Century):
• Development of Schools of Thought: Emergence of major Sunni (Hanafi, 
Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali) and Shia (Ja'fari) schools.
• Imam al-Shafi'i (d. 820 CE): Known as the "Father of Usul al-Fiqh," he 
systematically defined the principles in his work Al-Risala, establishing a 
structured framework.
• 3. Classical Period (10th-15th Century):
• Expansion and Refinement: Scholars expanded on Usul al-Fiqh, integrating 
linguistic, rational, and philosophical elements.
• Detailed works emerged, like those by Al-Ghazali (Al-Mustasfa) and Al-
Juwayni (Al-Burhan).
• 4. Later Period and Modern Times:
• Adaptation and Reform: Efforts to adapt Usul al-Fiqh to contemporary 
issues while maintaining core principles.
• Significance:
• Usul al-Fiqh evolved to provide a systematic methodology for deriving 
Islamic law from foundational texts.
Objectives of Sharia (Maqasid al-Sharia)
• Primary Objectives:
• Preservation of Religion (Din)
• Preservation of Life (Nafs)
• Preservation of Intellect (Aql)
• Preservation of Lineage (Nasl)
• Preservation of Property (Mal)
• Application: How these objectives influence modern rulings, e.g., 
health laws during pandemics to protect life.
Categories of Islamic Law
• Ibadat (Worship): Obligations like prayer, fasting, zakat (almsgiving), 
Hajj.
• Muamalat (Civil Transactions): Contract law, business transactions, 
family relations.
• Punishments (Hudud): Prescribed for theft, adultery, apostasy, with 
set conditions for implementation.
Islamic Criminal Law
• Hudud: Fixed punishments with strict evidentiary requirements (e.g., 
theft requires four witnesses).
• Qisas: Retribution, allowing victims’ families to seek punishment or 
forgive.
• Ta’zir: Discretionary punishments left to a judge’s interpretation, e.g., 
lesser offenses not covered by Hudud.
Islamic Family Law
• Marriage: A contractual relationship; mutual consent, dowry (mahr), 
and responsibilities.
• Divorce: Different forms include Talaq (initiated by husband), Khula
(initiated by wife), and mutual agreement.
• Inheritance: Quranic guidelines ensure specific shares for heirs (2:1 
male-to-female ratio in many cases).
Islamic Finance and Economic Principles
• Riba (Interest): Prohibited due to exploitation concerns; focus on 
equitable transactions.
• Zakat: Mandatory almsgiving, promoting wealth distribution and 
social welfare.
• Islamic Banking: Interest-free models (Mudarabah, Musharakah) 
based on profit/loss sharing.
